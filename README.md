# Matrix Motel

Matrix Motel is an open source virtual gaming client built on top of [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) taking inspiration from [Habbo](https://www.habbo.com/).

The client is built completely with HTML and JavaScript and only communicates with existing Matrix servers. For this reason, it needs no new server software to be downloaded and can be played on existing Matrix homeservers.
